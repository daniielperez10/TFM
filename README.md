This repository is part of my Master's thesis for the Master's in Computational Social Sciences at Universidad Carlos III.

My thesis aims to evaluate the impact of the Madrid Central policy in an innovative way by predicting the counterfactual using Machine Learning models.

The code is structured as follows:

1. DataFrame Creation: To execute this script correctly, you need to download files located in the folder named: "RAW DATA"
   
The output of this DataFrame is a file called "df_combined_complete," which contains pollution data from each station, both within the Municipality of Madrid and from peripheral areas of the Community of Madrid, information related to these stations such as their location, type, and other details, as well as weather data.
This output can be directly used to execute the following scripts if you wish to skip the DataFrame creation step.

2. Parallel Trends: To excute this script correctly, you need to download files located in the folder named: "PARALLEL TRENDS DATA"
